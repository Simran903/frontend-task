# Deep Thought Landing Page ðŸš€ 
This landing page is designed as a responsive interface for a mobile application, combining HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It focuses on delivering an appealing and user-friendly experience on both desktop and mobile devices.

## Requirements
- **Visual Studio Code**: This project is optimized for Visual Studio Code, but any text editor with live server support will work.
- **Git**: Git is required to clone the repository. Download Git [here](https://git-scm.com/).
- **Live Server Extension**: The Live Server extension is used to launch the HTML file in a local development server. Install it from the Visual Studio Code marketplace [here](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ritwickdey.LiveServer), or use a similar extension in your preferred text editor.

## Launch Steps
1. Ensure Visual Studio Code or your chosen text editor is installed.
2. Clone this repository using the command:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/username/frontend-task.git
   ```
3. Install the Live Server extension in Visual Studio Code or a similar extension in your preferred text editor.
4. Open the project folder in Visual Studio Code or your text editor.
5. Right-click on the `index.html` file.
6. Select 'Open with Live Server' from the context menu.
7. The landing page should open in your default browser. If it doesn't, manually open `http://localhost:5500/index.html` in your browser.

Now you can explore and interact with the responsive landing page for the mobile application. Enjoy!
